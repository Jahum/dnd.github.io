Warforged city, long abandoned
Built into a mountain? Too cliche? 
Massive walls with enclosed, THICK glass ceiling? Pipes remove waste products, dotted regularly along outer wall
Inaccessible to commoners/looters somehow. Must solve runic coin related puzzle to enter.

Runic coins given as change in market by mysterious shopkeeper. You only notice after you've turned away. When you turn back the shopkeeper is gone :0

Shopkeeper is warforged historian, trickster mage, chooses to lure famous adventurers with interesting challenge instead of begging for help. Follows group inside city and does own thing

Find coins with curious patterns on them (runic shapes)

They're part of a programming language. Find constructs, vending machines, shop fronts etc etc in city with slots that fit the coins. Place coins in slots in certain order to make stuff happen

Construct has mad lib style script with coin slots for the blanks. 
While <host> is safe, <guard host>
If <host> enters combat, <defend host>


Coins say things like "Guard" "Imprint host" "defend" "repair" "seige"

Write short if this then that scripts and construct will obey

	Vending machine:
		A script is already running. It accepts certain coins but not others. Imprinting an item and placing the imprinted item coin in the vending machine's slot results in a copper and brass soldered image of that item.
