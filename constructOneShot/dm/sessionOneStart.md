Strong Start
------------
Players are in a tavern together, nice and rested after a long break from their previous adventure (finding a giant under a seaside town!) 

A mysterious warforged stranger approches and places a canvas bag on their table, then leaves, melting into the crowd. They wore a black bandana around the lower part of their face, but they had a distinct copper streak across the top of their head. No hair. 

Inside the bag:
	- a map, showing this town with a circle around it, and a dotted line leading to a walled city at the base of a mountain several leagues away.
	- a strange metal object with a hinge in the middle. One side of the hinge is a cylinder with several variable depth notches at the tip, and the other side is thin and flat. It appears to be a copper alloy.
	- 3 coins with strange runes on one side. The other sides are blank. The coins have notches on the blank side, but the rune face is smooth.
		- follow
		- stand guard
		- imprint target (run script on compatible machine. Have target stay still in front of machine viewport. Do not move for 15 seconds. Stop script.)
	- A book with strange runes on the front, similar to the coins. "Rune translator" is written inside the cover, in a writing style different to the rest of the book. You flip through a few pages and see direct-to-common translations for the strange runic language.

Secrets and Clues

Fantastic Locations
-------------------
(only mentioned by NPCs) Warforged City called Detrias Major. Known for generations, unknown why it stopped functioning, unknown how to get in, it's been relaimed by Creshorn Forest

Creshorn Forest - a massive and ancient forest that was once clearfelled by the Warforged in order to build their city. After it's collapse, the forest grew and reclaimed it, well passed the last living survivor of the event. The forest is ancient, but not as ancient as the forgotten city.

Creshorn - a small village adjacent to Creshorn Forest. Crops grow extremely well and farmers from this village are very successful. Livestock, on the other hand, do not live well here and tend to get sick, or wander off during the night. 

Bladslow City - The town the players start in, where the local ruler lives and from where the cash and the motivation for the push into the Creshorn Forest originates. 



Important NPCs
--------------
Cres the Greater, Son of Cres the Elder (Full name: Cres Bladslow)
	- Ruler of Bladslow City
	- Viewed by his subjects as somewhat incompetent because of his speech impediment (stutter) but he's actually compassionate
	- His dad was way better
	- Influenced by his adviser, a wise old druid named Fangor Buckshorn
	- Cres the Elder died a year ago, and the city has pretty much stayed the same. 

Fangor Buckshorn
	- Got his name by rescuing two stags who became antler locked. The stags were thankful, and now accompany Fangor as companions. The pieces of antler that broke were crafted into the headpiece of a staff that Fangor leans on heavily when walking.
	- Very interested in ancient history and in particular Creshorn Forest, which is said to be a single living creature rather than thousands of small creatures living together, similar to a person being made up of trillions of tiny cells (he describes this)
